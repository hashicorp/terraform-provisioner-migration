# Provisioner Migration Guide

If you're currently using one of the four builtin vendor provisioners:
chef, habitat, puppet, or salt-masterless, this repository has a guide,
and an example using salt-masterless, in order to help you migrate off
of your vendor-specific provisioner to an alternative, or to the core provisioners
of local-exec, remote-exec, and the file provisioner.
